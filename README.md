Rental House Prices Prediction 🏠💰
This project predicts rental house prices using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (ANN) models. The dataset includes various features influencing rental prices, and models are trained to provide accurate predictions.

The ML model applies regression techniques for price estimation.
The Deep Learning model (ANN) enhances accuracy with neural networks.
A Streamlit application is included for easy user interaction, allowing users to input house details and get instant predictions.
The trained model is saved using Pickle for efficient deployment.
This project showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a structured manner. 🚀
